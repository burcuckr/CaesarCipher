# Day 8 – Caesar Cipher 🔐

This project is part of the **Udemy – 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

## 📝 Description
A Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

The program allows the user to:
- Encrypt a message (encode)
- Decrypt a message (decode)
- Choose any shift number
- Restart the program as many times as they want
- Preserve non-alphabet characters (such as spaces and punctuation)

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The user selects whether to encode or decode
- The user enters a message
- The user provides a shift number
- Each letter is shifted forward or backward in the alphabet
- The result is displayed
- The user can choose to run the program again or exit
