# Day 8 – Caesar Cipher 🔐

This project is part of the **Udemy – 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by Angela Yu.

## 📝 Description
A Python implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a classic encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

The program allows the user to:
- Encrypt a message (`encode`)
- Decrypt a message (`decode`)
- Choose any shift number
- Restart the program as many times as they want

Non-alphabet characters (such as spaces and punctuation) are preserved.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user selects whether to encode or decode.
2. The user enters a message.
3. The user provides a shift number.
4. Each letter is shifted forward or backward in the alphabet.
5. The result is displayed.
6. The user can choose to run the program again or exit.
